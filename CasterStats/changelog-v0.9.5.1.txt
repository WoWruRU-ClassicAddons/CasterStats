Adds a line to the stat section of the character frame below armor. This line can be
set to either show your total "+Spell Damage" or "+Healing" via the command line. 
Like the other stats in the character screen it provides more information when you 
mouse over it. The tooltip will display the totals for plus healing, spell damage, 
all individual schools of damage, spell crit, spell to hit, mana regen etc...

The information that is displayed is only additional stats provided by your gear. 
If you do not have any of the the listed stats it will not be visible. Caster Stats 
does not currently calculate crit, or mana regen from stats like int, spirit, or 
base crit. It is only mean't to be a quick way of finding the bonuses you are 
getting from your gear. I may implement more features in the future however.

While there are other mods out there that can total these stats for you, I wanted 
something that was more intune with the melee character stats. Something simple 
yet informative.

-Config
"/cstats" - Slash command for Caster Stats
"/cstats [damagetype]" - Allows you to choose the stat visible in the character screen. "damage" or "healing". 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.9.5.1
-- Now totals +damage to individual schools of magic as before

v0.9.5
-- Updated for 1.10
-- Now uses Bonus Scanner (http://www.curse-gaming.com/mod.php?addid=2384) to find bonuses instead of reinventing the wheel each patch/new item stat with my own scanner. This also allows prevents FR DE localizations from needing to be created multiple times. Bonusscanner is included in the download.
-- Added detection for negative spell resist to target (not yet implemented by Bonus Scanner)
-- Relocated the stats to be inside the frame with other stats
-- As before Caster Stats is not visible if you are a Warrior/Rogue, but now in addition healing does not show if you are not a healing class
-- Added FE DE localization. Please report if they are functional as I reformatted previous submissions. Will need modified version for both for the negative resists either way.
